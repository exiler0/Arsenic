Those raised earlier should be shifted to private land or removed within six months.It gave the directions on Friday while disposing of a writ petition filed by 19 locals against alleged encroachment of public pathway land in Mohalla Dauda Khera in Lucknow by construction of a temple.Observing that every citizen has a fundamental right of movement and this can not be allowed to be infringed by a few violators in public and apathy of state authorities, the high court also directed the state government to chalk out a plan so as to ensure that public roads were not obstructed due to observance of religious activities.It said such activities should not create hindrance in the smooth flow of traffic and movement of public on roads and should be performed strictly at the places identified for the same or belonging to concerned religious sections or at any private place.\"In our view, those who create such obstructions as also those who perpetuate it by taking care/managing such structures and also those who fail to take any action in law, all deserve to be taken to task and make responsible and accountable for their respective misdeeds,\" the court said.The court said it should be ensured that \"no religious structure in any form, whatsoever, shall be allowed/permitted to be raised on public road (including highways), street, pathway and lane, including sideways which is part and parcel of road and belong to the state\".It directed the state government through chief secretary to issue a general direction in this regard to all DMs and senior superintendent of police/superintendent of police including the officers responsible for maintenance of roads (including highways) in the state.",

In the early 1990s, the then BJP MLA from Buxar's Brahampur seat, SN Tewari, had continuously raised the issue of the fast-growing population of Nilgai in the assembly. However, then CM Lalu Prasad had asked the forest department to use drum beats to scare away the animal.The operation to cull the nilgai was undertaken at the initiative of JD(U) MLA Neeraj Kumar who approached professional shooters. Reports say that around 200 Nilgais have been killed recently. \"Maneka's opposition to killing of nilgai clearly shows that she is unaware of the problems our poor farmers face in Mokama area. The Centre issued a gazette notification putting nilgai under Schedule 5 on December 1, 2015.This led to permission for killing nilgai. Why was she silent all these months,\" asked MLC Neeraj.

And the one striking strand in their speeches was that neither deemed it appropriate to mention his predecessor despite obvious references to his contribution to Indo-US relations.Both mentioned the addresses by past PMs of their own parties while choosing different icons (Nehru and Ambedkar) to underline the influence of US Constitution and values in the framing of the Indian Constitution.Modi did not mention Manmohan Singh in his Wednesday's address despite two references about Indo-US civil nuclear deal. Likewise, Manmohan Singh in his address to the joint sitting of the American Congress, on July 19, 2005, did not mention Atal Bihar Vajpayee despite quoting him on India and America being \"natural allies.\"\"In the fall of 2008, when the Congress passed the India-US Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, it changed the very colours of leaves of our relationship,\" Modi said before adding, \"civil nuclear cooperation, as I told President Obama yesterday, is a reality.\"Singh, however, did not find mention despite the fact that it was he who risked his government in Parliament against the combined wrath of Modi's BJP and the Left parties in July 2008, before the US Congress passed the India-US Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement in September 2008.But a scrutiny of Singh's 2005 speech leaves little reason for him to complain against Modi's omission of his name on Wednesday. Singh referred to Rajiv Gandhi 's speech from \"this very podium two decades ago (1985)\" but did not mention Atal Bihari Vajpayee 's speech made in 2000, which set the pace for the cordial relations between India and America.\"As two great democracies, we are natural partners in many ways,\" Singh said. Modi, in turn, credited Vajpayee for this coinage referring to him twice in his speech: \"Our independence was ignited by the same idealism that fuelled your struggle for freedom.No wonder then that former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee called India and the US natural allies,\" Modi said. \"More than fifteen years ago, Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, stood here and gave a call to step out of the shadow of hesitation of the past.\"Modi and Singh chose different icons to underline the influence of American Constitution on the Indian Constitution. While Singh had used Jawaharlal Nehru to buttress his point, Modi cited Ambedkar to drive home the same point.As against 3,264 words of Singh's speech in 2005, Modi's speech comprised 2,754 words. Singh mentioned incumbent president George Bush many more times than Modi mentioned Obama. But, Modi mentioned 8 icons from the past as against 4 mentioned by Singh.",

At present, it is taking every possible effort to displace the Opposition Congress as the main alternative. Apparently, Didi's party is now planning to go national, at least in her sole aim of making the Left irrelevant in national politics.Even though, Trinamool Congress succeeded in opening its account in north east states like Tripura and Manipur, her targets have been the states where communists still have considerable presence.With her attempts to foray into Tripura, one of the two red bastions in the country, TMC leaders are not ruling out possibility of making efforts to make an inroad into Kerala Speaking to ET, TMC's national vice president Mukul Roy said, \"We are determined to oust the CPM government from Tripura in 2018 assembly election. Our party supremo would be addressing a couple of public meetings in the state on June 14th and 15th.\" Meanwhile, Mamata's pointsman, Roy has managed to have six defections from the Congress, the principal Opposition in Tripura, to the Trinamool Congress.Explaining Trinamool's political expansion to the North-East, Roy said, \"In Tripura, soil is ready. There is enough anti-incumbency and people do not now see Congress as an alternative. So, people are now looking up to Mamata Banerjee and Trimaool would soon grow there. 2018 assembly election is crucial for us. And we are sure to gain grounds in Tripura.

Sarkar is now continuing with his fifth consecutive term. A couple of days back, six of the 10 Congress MLAs defected to Trinamool Congress.Significantly, Trinamool Congress performed well in the Manipur Assembly Election in 2012, grabbing 7 seats. Speaking about party's position in Manipur, Roy said that TMC did well in Manipur in last election and it would make things better in the north-eastern state.The green party from Bengal tried to make inroad in Kerala too. Banerjee before election said that she would travel to the southern state and expose the CPM-Congress who had an alliance in Bengal and were fighting each other in Kerala. However, Mamata's plans for Kerala did not take off this time. \"We will enter Kerala soon. But now we are focusing on Tripura now,\" added Rory.",

The zest and enthusiasm for Modi exhibited by members of the US Congress is \"unimaginable\", he said.Modi's call to isolate the countries sponsoring terror is also receiving support across the world, Shah said.The investment commitment made by US companies will help generate jobs and boost projects like 'Make in India' once these promises are realised, he said.

Those Muslims who did not wish to follow the same were free to marry under the Special Marriages Act.AIMPLB executive member Dr Asma Zehra attacked those seeking scrapping of triple talaq saying, \"Some letter head organisations and women andolans have presented false concocted data in their survey re port, in which it is shown that 92% of Muslim women are in favour of ban on triple talaq and amendments in the Muslim personal law.

It is portrayed that Islamic Law is anti women and cruel. This is not true.

And discharging that duty, I wrote what I thought was true,\" he said.Singh said he hoped the state government would make the report public soon.\"I hope that Government puts this in public domain soon and ends its secrecy because many people have started to speculate about various things,\" he said.The Prakash Singh Committee report, submitted to the Haryana Chief Minister over a week back, found \"deliberate negligence\" on the part of 90 officials, including IAS and IPS officers, during the Jat quota agitation in February.The 450-page report submitted to the CM on May 13 is likely to be put in the public domain by month-end, official sources said.Singh said the officials who were negligent in performing their duty have been identified and their names given to the government.\"The government, on its part, has also started taking action on the report, many SDM, DSPs have been suspended,\" he said.",

Both sides should strive to ensure that outstanding issues are addressed in a manner that demonstrates mutual sensitivity to each other's concerns, interests and aspirations,\" he had said last week.",

        "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress on Saturday alleged that the BJP-led NDA government's claim of achievements was a \"lie\" and it \"has not fulfilled any of the promises in the last two years\".\"Be it in jobs creation, growth in agriculture sector, GDP growth, containing food inflation and GDP growth, Modi government is a total failure. The achievements that the government talked about is a lie and it has not fulfilled any of the promises in the last two years rule,\" senior Congress leader Anil K Shastri told reporters here.He said the most laughable promise of Modi was with regard to bringing back black money and depositing Rs 15 lakh each in the bank accounts of every citizen.\"No black money has been unearthed. On the other hand more black money has come in the market,\" Shastri alleged.NDA that came to power on the plank of development had failed in keeping the promises and \"all indices affecting the ordinary citizen are in dire straits\".The agriculture growth of minus 0.2 per cent was the lowest growth rate in the sector in the recent years, he alleged.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his frequent foreign visits, Shastri said, \"It is not to promote India, but to promote Prime Minister himself. Let him promote himself, but he is not going to get any Nobel prize,\" Shastri said, adding, \"Modi has to be sensitive to the needs and aspirations of the people of the country\".He also attacked the Foreign policy of the NDA and said, \"it has been inconsistent, inept and incompetent\".To a question on the drubbing the party had received in the recent assembly polls, he said in Assam it was the anti-incumbency factor that led to the defeat. Besides, there was a false propaganda on emigrants by the BJP. However, he went on to add, \"We respect the mandate of the people.\"In Tamil Nadu, he said Congress was only a minor player.With regard to Kerala, Shastri maintained that UDF and LDF used to share the power alternately.However, he said the increase in the vote share of BJP has to be viewed seriously. \"Only Congress can stop the growth of BJP in the state,\" he claimed.\"BJP is covertly and overtly indulging in communal polarisation across the country,\" he alleged.",

We have to prepare within a time frame the NRC ( National Register of Citizens) with the names of bonafide Indian citizens. These are two big challenges,\" 54-year-old Sonowal said.Influx of Bangladeshis through the porous Indo-Bangla border has been a major issue in Assam and BJP and its allies had promised during the election campaign to check it.Sonowal said containing corruption will be another focus area. He said people were fed up with Congress and they wanted change and good government.\"People have accepted our winning combination. This is a great victory. People of Assam have been looking for such a combination... Our main target is to protect the interests of bonafide Indian citizens, whether they are Hindu or Muslims it doesn't matter.\"We have to protect the interests of greater Assamese society, which include Assamese, Bihari Marwaris, Bengalis, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs... We have to work together, live together and fight together,\" he said soon after it became clear that BJP for the first time would get a majority in the 126-seat state Assembly.The Union Minister played down challenges to him from within the winning alliance, saying they all have to work together.BJP had stitched an alliance of virtually all regional parties, which represent various sections of indigenous population, to take on Congress and AIUDF, accusing the two parties of supporting infiltrators, mostly Bangladeshi Muslims.",

That is what the Rakesh Mohan committee report had said. So now we are trying to create a situation where the railways will be able to breathe well,\" he told PTI.Asked whether the national transporter is still in the ICU, he said, \"We are trying to take it out of the ICU.\"On measures to make it robust, Prabhu said, \"In order to survive, the railways needs to revamp its operation. We are working on it. We are making it sure that the railways will be an engine of growth in the next few years. We are putting all our efforts into it.\"To a question about the railways' strategy since loadings are falling, the minister said a capacity to handle 1.2 billion tons of cargo will be created in the coming years.\"Freight (traffic) falling is not in our hands, it depends on the growth of the core sector. When core sector grows freight will also grow. But we are ready to handle 1.2 billion tons of cargo. In the railways' history for the first time, we have created such a handling capacity ahead of its demand. So now cargo has to come,\" he said.Asked whether the railways is considering hiking passenger fare since the freight is not picking up and passengers growth rate is also not high, Prabhu said the regulatory authority will decide on it.\"We are setting up a regulatory framework for fare decision. The regulator will decide what should be the fare,\" he said.On certain trains being introduced recently with increased fare, he hinted at a possible separate fare structure for the new services.\"We are starting four new products - Humsafar, Tejas, Antodaya and Uday. All these products will look at how to increase market share of the railways,\" the minister said.While the fare of recently launched Gatimaan Express is 25 per cent higher than Shatabdi, Mahamana Express was started with 15 per cent more than the regular train fare.According to Rail Budget proposals, Humsafar would be fully air-conditioned third AC service with an optional service for meals. Tejas, on the other hand, will showcase the future of train travel in India with operating speeds of 130 kmph and have on-board services such as entertainment, local cuisine, Wi-Fi.The railways also propose introduction of overnight Utkrisht Double-decker Air-conditioned Yatri (UDAY) Express on the busiest routes, which has the potential to increase carrying capacity by almost 40 per cent.There is also a proposal for the introduction of Antyodaya Express, a long-distance, fully unreserved, super-fast train service, for the common man to be operated on dense routes.",
